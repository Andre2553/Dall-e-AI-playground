# DALL-E AI Playground

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project that utilizes the OpenAI API and DALL-E to generate creative images. The project allows users to input a prompt and receive a variety of unique responses generated by DALL-E. Additionally, the project uses MongoDB to store user input and generated responses for future reference. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the OpenAI API and DALL-E in a practical and user-friendly application.
